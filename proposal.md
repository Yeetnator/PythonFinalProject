# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The hero's advent (Is a working title)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Is gonna be a turn based role playing game where you and your party fight monsters to together eventually reaching a final boss (very likely to be a dragon)

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I'm gonna implements the game mechanics and build the project through pygame and it gonna be a sprite based game using sprite that I found online. The code will be able to boot up in any system and have customizable size window that it run on. In summary, it will be a turn based rpg sprite based game run in 60 fps and a customizable window. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will hope to get the game running with all the features and story I intend no matter what. Video games developers tends to cram no matter what after all.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

To get the game running without bug and all the story I intended. I know it is ambitious but I intend to finish the game before the deadline with no exception. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Like I mentioned above, is to get the game running smoothly. I will make the game run no matter the cost. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will have to learn pygame mechanics and how to input sprites (would take about a week). Then from that knowledge outline the game mechanics and combat in a way that suitable for pygame (would take about 1-2 weeks). Then onto  writting the story and interaction would take another week and find sprites. Finally, I would debug the code for the last week of the project.
