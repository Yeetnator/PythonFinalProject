# PythonFinalProject
The video will be upload late due to some issues with my computer audio and I couldn't record.

Difficulties that I faced:
- A lot of challenges, I want to do a lot for the projects and despite watching a long tutorial to guide my way through, I still struggled a lot and have to spent a lot of time reading up on documentary of different features of pygame and dedicated the majority of my time in these past few weeks in doing so and make progress on the projects
What I have learned:
- I learned a lot of features in pygame like time, sprites-handling, simple animations, etc.... I even added some new features compare to the original like better collison mechanics, different type of spells and more UI and player handling to make the game run smoother
What I have enjoyed:
- I never knew I would enjoy game-designing so much, I really enjoyed seeing the animations, interactions and mechanics that I learned and created really makes me happy and push me forward on keep on completing the game no matter how tired I was. If I have to go back in time, I wouldn't have done anything differently and I'm proud to be able to give it my all in this projects. Thank you, Professor Rosen for giving me this oppurtunity
