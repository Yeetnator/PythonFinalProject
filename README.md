This is not completely my own work and I use a video tutorial under a CC license

Difficulties that I faced:

- A lot of challenges, I wanted to do a lot for the projects and despite watching a long tutorial to guide my way through, I still struggled a lot and have to spend a lot of time reading up on documentaries of different features of pygame and dedicated the majority of my time in these past few weeks in doing so and make progress on the projects
What I have learned:
- I learned a lot of features in pygame like time, sprites-handling, simple animations, etc... I even added some new features compared to the original like better collision mechanics, different types of spells, and more UI and player handling to make the game run smoother
What I have enjoyed:

- I never knew I would enjoy game design so much, I enjoyed seeing the animations, interactions, and mechanics that I learned and created, which really made me happy and pushed me forward to keep on completing the game no matter how tired I was. If I had to go back in time, I wouldn't have done anything differently and I'm proud to be able to give it my all in this project. Thank you, Professor Rosen, for giving me this opportunity
